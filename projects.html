                    Deepblocks is an artificial intelligence company converging 3D modeling, machine learning, and financial analysis within real estate development to provide city-wide intelligence.
                
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2021, I interned at Deepblocks as both lead of the public relations intern team and dashboard developer. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As dashboard developer, I worked with one other intern to develop a web program that tracks customer engagement with the Deepblocks software via Intercom, including subscription price, initiation/termination dates, geographical information, customer MRR, and more. 
                    The dashboard was coded in HTML and Python, using Plotly, Dash, and Pandas.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As the dashboard becomes more developed, the Deepblocks team hopes to include its data visualizations in the company's investment deck.
                    
                </p>

                <h5>
                    Note: Only clips of the dashboard are captured in the images as to respect the information of Deepblocks and its customers.
                    
                </h5>
